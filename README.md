This code uses only numpy and pandas to implement a simple neural network with fully connected layers
The goal of this project was to understand the underlying math behind back propagation

The project is a model that classifies digits from 0-9 from the MNIST database of handwritten digits. All code for forward propagation, backpropagation, (stochastic) gradient descent is written explicitly.
